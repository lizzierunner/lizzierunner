## 🌌 Hitchhiker’s Wisdom
> “Don’t Panic.” ✌️  
> “The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is… **42**.”  
> “So long, and thanks for all the fish.” 🐟  
> “I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.”  
> “Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”  
> “A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.”  
> “The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don’t.”  
> “In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.”

## 🕵️ Funny Dirk Gently Quotes
> “I rarely end up where I was intending to go, but often I end up somewhere that I needed to be.”  
> “Let’s think the unthinkable, let’s do the undoable… and see if we may not eff the ineffable after all.”  
> “The impossible often has a kind of integrity which the merely improbable lacks.”  
> “I am not deliberately mysterious. I am inscrutable by accident.”  
> “Everything is connected.”
